## Summary
Most rides during the week are forcused on before and after working hours, while those on the weekends are more concentrated midday.  To determine if a bike sharing business is viable we should also look at cooler months (Dec/Jan), we should also compare the temperature of NYC to Des Moines.  Another visualization would be maping the top start/end locations to attractions and population density and using this to determine the potential impacts to Des Moines.
